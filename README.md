# Sentiment-Analysis-using-PySpark

Sentiment Analysis of large-scale data has become increasingly important and urging researchers to use new platforms and tools that can handle large volumes of data. In this project, we present new evaluation experiments of sentiment analysis for a large-scale dataset of online customer’s reviews under PySpark data Processing System. PySpark’s scalable machine learning library (MLlib) is used and three classification techniques from the library are applied; Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model.  The results show that the Logistic Regression classifier outperforms Naive Bayes and Linear SVC classifiers.
